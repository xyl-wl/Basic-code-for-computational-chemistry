# Basic-code-for-computational-chemistry
This repository contains basic code examples—such as function definitions (def), for loops, and other foundational constructs—designed to help learners get started with computational chemistry.
Here are some materials I've compiled during my self-study journey. Feel free to connect with me if you'd like to discuss or offer any feedback—I'm always open to suggestions!
